Caravan - app

This was a Full Stack group project completed in May 2019.

The purpose of this app was to allow outdoor sport enthusiasts (mainly climbers) to meetup using friend requests and calendar invites.

We used HTML and CSS for the front end and styling.
We used Node.js for communicating with the backend
We used javascript and SQL for database queries
And We used Heroku to host our database and websites.
